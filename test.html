PART 1: RESERVATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS VI
INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Your reservation and the accommodation agreement made with a hotel within the Small Luxury Hotels of the World™ brand (whether made by you directly with SLH or via a third party such as a travel agent) will be subject to these Reservation Terms and Conditions and the Reservation Privacy Policy set out below.  When you make your reservation, whether online or by telephone, you will be deemed to have read, understood and accepted these Reservation Terms and Conditions and the Reservation Privacy Policy.

If you make your reservation via a travel agent, or other third party, then you have a separate legal relationship with that party and Small Luxury Hotels of the World Limited ("SLH"TM) has no liability for any acts or omissions of such party including their observance of your data protection rights.

When you make your reservation, you will be also deemed to have read, understood and accepted the terms and conditions for using the SLH website (which shall mean www.slh.com or any related SLH web pages accessible from it) and any relevant terms and conditions shall be deemed to be incorporated into your reservation and the accommodation agreement with the SLH hotel.  The link to the terms and conditions for using the SLH website is https://www.slh.com/about-us/terms-of-use/

Small Luxury Hotels of the World Limited ("SLH"TM) does not own or manage any of the hotels which are current members of the SLH brand ("SLH hotels").

SLH provides an online reservations facility on the SLH website and a telephone facility for making reservations at SLH hotels (together called "the Reservations Facility") as an independent service provider and acts solely as an intermediary between you and the SLH hotels. Accordingly, your reservation and the accommodation agreement is made directly with the SLH hotel of your choice and your use of the Reservations Facility will not result in any contractual relationship between you and SLH.

All information regarding rooms, facilities and services offered at the SLH hotels contained on the SLH website or otherwise available through the Reservations Facility has been provided to SLH by an SLH hotel.  SLH does not make any representation or warranty, express or implied, of any kind with respect thereto.  Such information may be inaccurate as a result of renovation or repair at the SLH hotel.  The SLH website may also contain typographical errors or omissions.  SLH shall not be liable for any discrepancy in the rooms, facilities or services available at an SLH hotel from those described on the SLH website or for any other errors or omissions, and shall not be liable for any damages that may result therefrom.

As there will be no contractual agreement between you and SLH, and as SLH does not control or verify the hotel information that SLH hotels submit to or through the Reservations Facility, SLH shall not be liable to you for:

(i)  the accuracy of any SLH hotel information provided to or through the Reservations Facility including, without limitation, the availability or price of rooms; or

(ii) any failure or delay beyond its control in the transmission of any data submitted through the Service including, but not limited to, the details of your reservation or changes to or cancellation of your reservation.

 

RESERVATIONS PROCEDURE AND POLICIES

 

1. Online reservations

The SLH website enables you to check the accommodation offerings and availability of SLH hotels, as indicated to SLH by each SLH hotel, and then submit an online reservation request to the SLH hotel of your choice.  On completion of the reservation process the Reservations Facility will transmit an online confirmation of your reservation.  A reservation is only valid when a reservation number has been issued.

2. Hotel Prices

The prices indicated on the SLH website for the SLH hotel rooms are subject to availability.  Breakfast is only included if indicated in the rate policy.  Taxes and service charges are only included if indicated in the rate policy.

3. Payment

It will be necessary for you to provide credit card details to secure a room reservation.  The credit card may then be used by the SLH hotel for payment of a deposit as advised at the time of booking or as a guarantee for a future payment, in the case of a no-show, a cancellation or change to the reservation.

4. Cancellations and Amendments

You should make any cancellations or amendments to your reservation using the same SLH channel through which you booked, either online or by telephone.  The cancellations and amendments policy that applies to your reservation will depend on the respective SLH hotel's policy as advised at the time of booking.

5. Rate/Reservation Validity

Reservation confirmations are provided to you solely for your convenience.  SLH and SLH hotels retain official records of reservation transactions, including details of dates of stay and room rates. In the event of discrepancies, alterations, modifications, or variations between this confirmation and our official records, SLH’s official records shall prevail. Tampering with this confirmation to alter the room rate or any other reservation information is strictly prohibited and will have legal consequences.

6. Early Departure

Some SLH hotels and resorts have an early departure penalty fee and some room rates may also require a minimum stay. You may change your check out date without a penalty only if your rate and the SLH hotel’s policy permits.

7. Currency

Reservations will be charged in the hotel’s local currency as shown on the SLH website or given over the telephone at the time of booking.  Any currency conversion is for guidance only.  Any deposits or pre-payments will be deducted from the final reservation invoice in the hotel’s local currency.

A refund of a deposit or prepayment, if any, will be subject to the exchange rate applied by your payment card provider at the time of any such refund and may differ from the exchange rate applied at the time such deposit or prepayment was made.

8. Rate Requirements

As some rates have special requirements at check-in, you should verify that you qualify for the rate that you have reserved.  SLH hotels are not obligated to honour this rate if you do not qualify or do not have proof of qualification.

9. Pre-paid Reservations

Some rate plans require prepayment in full and are non-cancellable, non-refundable, non-changeable and non-transferable. This will be identified in the rate description.  For these rate plans, once you make a reservation your credit card will be charged for the full amount. Credit will not be given for any unused reservation and the amount paid by you for such reservation cannot be used toward any other/future reservation.

10. Guarantee Rules

For reservations guaranteed with a credit card at the time of making your reservation, rooms are held until the SLH hotel check-out time on the day following the day of arrival.  The SLH hotel may authorise the room rate prior to arrival and reserve funds, including taxes, on the credit card to determine the validity of the credit card.  Rooms booked with an invalid credit card are subject to immediate cancellation.

11. Overbooking

In the event that a guest cannot be accommodated due to the SLH hotel overbooking or an unforeseen circumstance, the SLH hotel will attempt to accommodate guests, at its expense, at a comparable property in the area for the night(s) for which the SLH hotel is unable to accommodate such guests, and will pay for transportation to that property.

12. Special Requests

SLH hotels will strive to honour any request for specific room types or bed types and some SLH hotels will confirm such arrangements at the time you make your reservation.  Until specific confirmation is issued then your request cannot be guaranteed and neither SLH nor the SLH hotel can guarantee that your request will be honoured.

13. Pets

If you plan to travel with your pet, we recommend that you confirm directly with SLH or the SLH hotel that the SLH hotel does accept pets.  SLH accepts no responsibility for the pet policy at any individual SLH hotel.  Specific pet policies may require a damage/cleaning deposit at the time of check-in which may be non-refundable.

14. External services

The SLH website or the SLH hotel at which you stay may advertise the opportunity to purchase products or services from independent third party suppliers (“independent suppliers”) including, by way of illustration only and without limitation, [excursions, yacht charters, other examples] (“external services”).

(ii)     Your contract for any external services will be made direct with the relevant independent supplier and neither SLH or your SLH hotel has any involvement in or control over the provision of external services.  Consequently, neither SLH or your SLH hotel will have any liability to you for the warranties, representations, acts, errors, omissions, breaches or negligence of any independent supplier or for any accidents, personal injuries, death, loss of or damage to property or any other losses, damages, costs or expenses resulting, directly or indirectly, from your purchase or use of any external service.

It is your responsibility to check that, where appropriate, the independent supplier has adequate public liability insurance for the external service and/or to ensure that you and any dependents or associates using the external service have adequate personal insurance cover against all foreseeable risks.

15. Guest’s obligations

You agree to the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by SLH and each SLH hotel.

PART 1: RESERVATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS VIII
INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Your reservation and the accommodation agreement made with a hotel within the Small Luxury Hotels of the World™ brand (whether made by you directly with SLH or via a third party such as a travel agent) will be subject to these Reservation Terms and Conditions and the Reservation Privacy Policy set out below.  When you make your reservation, whether online or by telephone, you will be deemed to have read, understood and accepted these Reservation Terms and Conditions and the Reservation Privacy Policy.

If you make your reservation via a travel agent, or other third party, then you have a separate legal relationship with that party and Small Luxury Hotels of the World Limited ("SLH"TM) has no liability for any acts or omissions of such party including their observance of your data protection rights.

When you make your reservation, you will be also deemed to have read, understood and accepted the terms and conditions for using the SLH website (which shall mean www.slh.com or any related SLH web pages accessible from it) and any relevant terms and conditions shall be deemed to be incorporated into your reservation and the accommodation agreement with the SLH hotel.  The link to the terms and conditions for using the SLH website is https://www.slh.com/about-us/terms-of-use/

Small Luxury Hotels of the World Limited ("SLH"TM) does not own or manage any of the hotels which are current members of the SLH brand ("SLH hotels").

SLH provides an online reservations facility on the SLH website and a telephone facility for making reservations at SLH hotels (together called "the Reservations Facility") as an independent service provider and acts solely as an intermediary between you and the SLH hotels. Accordingly, your reservation and the accommodation agreement is made directly with the SLH hotel of your choice and your use of the Reservations Facility will not result in any contractual relationship between you and SLH.

All information regarding rooms, facilities and services offered at the SLH hotels contained on the SLH website or otherwise available through the Reservations Facility has been provided to SLH by an SLH hotel.  SLH does not make any representation or warranty, express or implied, of any kind with respect thereto.  Such information may be inaccurate as a result of renovation or repair at the SLH hotel.  The SLH website may also contain typographical errors or omissions.  SLH shall not be liable for any discrepancy in the rooms, facilities or services available at an SLH hotel from those described on the SLH website or for any other errors or omissions, and shall not be liable for any damages that may result therefrom.

As there will be no contractual agreement between you and SLH, and as SLH does not control or verify the hotel information that SLH hotels submit to or through the Reservations Facility, SLH shall not be liable to you for:

(i)  the accuracy of any SLH hotel information provided to or through the Reservations Facility including, without limitation, the availability or price of rooms; or

(ii) any failure or delay beyond its control in the transmission of any data submitted through the Service including, but not limited to, the details of your reservation or changes to or cancellation of your reservation.

 

RESERVATIONS PROCEDURE AND POLICIES

 

1. Online reservations

The SLH website enables you to check the accommodation offerings and availability of SLH hotels, as indicated to SLH by each SLH hotel, and then submit an online reservation request to the SLH hotel of your choice.  On completion of the reservation process the Reservations Facility will transmit an online confirmation of your reservation.  A reservation is only valid when a reservation number has been issued.

2. Hotel Prices

The prices indicated on the SLH website for the SLH hotel rooms are subject to availability.  Breakfast is only included if indicated in the rate policy.  Taxes and service charges are only included if indicated in the rate policy.

3. Payment

It will be necessary for you to provide credit card details to secure a room reservation.  The credit card may then be used by the SLH hotel for payment of a deposit as advised at the time of booking or as a guarantee for a future payment, in the case of a no-show, a cancellation or change to the reservation.

4. Cancellations and Amendments

You should make any cancellations or amendments to your reservation using the same SLH channel through which you booked, either online or by telephone.  The cancellations and amendments policy that applies to your reservation will depend on the respective SLH hotel's policy as advised at the time of booking.

5. Rate/Reservation Validity

Reservation confirmations are provided to you solely for your convenience.  SLH and SLH hotels retain official records of reservation transactions, including details of dates of stay and room rates. In the event of discrepancies, alterations, modifications, or variations between this confirmation and our official records, SLH’s official records shall prevail. Tampering with this confirmation to alter the room rate or any other reservation information is strictly prohibited and will have legal consequences.

6. Early Departure

Some SLH hotels and resorts have an early departure penalty fee and some room rates may also require a minimum stay. You may change your check out date without a penalty only if your rate and the SLH hotel’s policy permits.

7. Currency

Reservations will be charged in the hotel’s local currency as shown on the SLH website or given over the telephone at the time of booking.  Any currency conversion is for guidance only.  Any deposits or pre-payments will be deducted from the final reservation invoice in the hotel’s local currency.

A refund of a deposit or prepayment, if any, will be subject to the exchange rate applied by your payment card provider at the time of any such refund and may differ from the exchange rate applied at the time such deposit or prepayment was made.

8. Rate Requirements

As some rates have special requirements at check-in, you should verify that you qualify for the rate that you have reserved.  SLH hotels are not obligated to honour this rate if you do not qualify or do not have proof of qualification.

9. Pre-paid Reservations

Some rate plans require prepayment in full and are non-cancellable, non-refundable, non-changeable and non-transferable. This will be identified in the rate description.  For these rate plans, once you make a reservation your credit card will be charged for the full amount. Credit will not be given for any unused reservation and the amount paid by you for such reservation cannot be used toward any other/future reservation.

10. Guarantee Rules

For reservations guaranteed with a credit card at the time of making your reservation, rooms are held until the SLH hotel check-out time on the day following the day of arrival.  The SLH hotel may authorise the room rate prior to arrival and reserve funds, including taxes, on the credit card to determine the validity of the credit card.  Rooms booked with an invalid credit card are subject to immediate cancellation.

11. Overbooking

In the event that a guest cannot be accommodated due to the SLH hotel overbooking or an unforeseen circumstance, the SLH hotel will attempt to accommodate guests, at its expense, at a comparable property in the area for the night(s) for which the SLH hotel is unable to accommodate such guests, and will pay for transportation to that property.

12. Special Requests

SLH hotels will strive to honour any request for specific room types or bed types and some SLH hotels will confirm such arrangements at the time you make your reservation.  Until specific confirmation is issued then your request cannot be guaranteed and neither SLH nor the SLH hotel can guarantee that your request will be honoured.

13. Pets

If you plan to travel with your pet, we recommend that you confirm directly with SLH or the SLH hotel that the SLH hotel does accept pets.  SLH accepts no responsibility for the pet policy at any individual SLH hotel.  Specific pet policies may require a damage/cleaning deposit at the time of check-in which may be non-refundable.

14. External services

The SLH website or the SLH hotel at which you stay may advertise the opportunity to purchase products or services from independent third party suppliers (“independent suppliers”) including, by way of illustration only and without limitation, [excursions, yacht charters, other examples] (“external services”).  The following provisions apply to all external services:

(i)       All information on the SLH website or otherwise communicated by SLH regarding external services has been provided to SLH and your SLH hotel by the independent suppliers.

Neither SLH or your SLH hotel makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the nature, quality, cost or any other aspect of the external services and it is your responsibility to check all relevant details of the external services with the independent supplier prior to purchase or booking. 

(ii)     Your contract for any external services will be made direct with the relevant independent supplier and neither SLH or your SLH hotel has any involvement in or control over the provision of external services.  Consequently, neither SLH or your SLH hotel will have any liability to you for the warranties, representations, acts, errors, omissions, breaches or negligence of any independent supplier or for any accidents, personal injuries, death, loss of or damage to property or any other losses, damages, costs or expenses resulting, directly or indirectly, from your purchase or use of any external service.

It is your responsibility to check that, where appropriate, the independent supplier has adequate public liability insurance for the external service and/or to ensure that you and any dependents or associates using the external service have adequate personal insurance cover against all foreseeable risks.

15. Guest’s obligations

You agree to the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by SLH and each SLH hotel.  You also agree that you are fully responsible and shall pay for all charges, fees, duties, taxes, assessments and other amounts arising out of your reservation when due, including additional taxes and fees that may not be included in the quoted rate.
